 # RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE CREATION IN AMAZON
## AIM
To Relational Database Service Creation in Amazon.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The experiment aims to demonstrate the creation of an Amazon RDS instance for hosting a relational database in the cloud. This includes configuring database settings, connecting to the instance, and testing database functionality using SQL commands.

 ### Steps 4:
 Configure network settings, including VPC, Subnet Group, and Security Group to allow access to the database.
 ### Steps 5:
 Launch the RDS instance, connect to it using a database client (e.g., MySQL Workbench or CLI), and test its functionality by creating and querying a sample table.
